# Information Retrieval System

#### A prototype of an Information Retrieval system with all the necessary steps which are required like the data analyses, text pre-processing, indexing, model building, and the evaluation. The project is an attempt to achieve all these tasks without the help of any external API or library.
The project is written in jupyter notebook and is a .ipynb file. You would need jupyter notebook or equivalent to open the file.

The execution of the sections like Lemmatization, POS tagging and the creation of inverted index takes a lot of time.

Make sure to change the location or path of the data or collection is changed according to your system
